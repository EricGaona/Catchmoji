## Technologies Used
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><img src="assets/images/html.png" alt="HTML logo" width="10%"></a> 
 The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML was used to construct the base of our website and structure.
 <br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"><img src="assets/images/css.png" alt="CSS logo" width="7.2%"></a> 
 Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS was used to style our website and make it responsive.
 <br>
 <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"><img src="assets/images/bootstrap.png" alt="Bootstrap logo" width="10%"></a>
 Bootstrap is a free, open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first, front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
We used Bootstrap for our project to create the index.html file and create a great user experience.
<br>
 <a href="https://www.javascript.com/"><img src="assets/images/js.png" alt="Javascript logo" width="9%"></a>
 Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. We used Javascript to create our questions and answers on the website.
 <br>
 <a href="https://fonts.google.com/"><img src="assets/images/google-fonts.png" alt="Google Fonts logo" width="10%"></a>
 Google Fonts is a computer font and web font service owned by Google. We used it to import some fonts that we wanted to use on our website to make it look more visually appealing.
 <br>
 <a href="https://balsamiq.com/"><img src="assets/images/balsamiq.png" alt="Balsamiq logo" width="10%"></a>
 Balsamiq is a wireframes tool used to construct basic mock ups. We used this to help form our ideas for the design of the site and as a reference.

## Features
When planning our project, there were a number of features we wanted to implement. Due to time constraints we could not achieve them all. Below we have laid out what we have and haven't achieved.
* ### Existing Features
    - #### Catchmoji Game
    The Catchmoji game is a simple guessing game. Each set of emojis represent a catch phrase or well known saying. For each set of emojis, the player is given multiple options to choose from and must choose the correct answer to win.
    - #### Footer 
    The footer includes copyright text and links to social media. 

* ### Future Features
    - #### Drag and Drop
    Initially we wanted to use a drag and drop feature in the Catchmoji game, however since it would take a longer time we decided to go with the simplier method of multiple choice. Drag and drop is something that could be implemented later on.

## Design
For this project, design began once we had a rough idea of what kind of game we wanted to create. Once we decided how we were going to implement it, we then designed the site around the game.
